MOD_JBMAPS2_DESC="Maps2 is a super easy tool to use to add a google map to your Joomla website. To get started just enter a location to search for and then when you have found it click on the preview where you want to place your marker. You can also drag the map preview in the admin to position the map perfectly on the front end. Also be sure to check out the different map styles in the styles tab. Have fun! "
